# Questions

## 1. What's loss function and cost functions ? are they same ?

## 2. What loss function give us ? What cost function give us ? What is the use of this functions ?
 
## 3. If we have neural network with tow layers, first have 3 neu. second 1 neu, and we apply a linear function for first layer and sigmoid func. for second layer, we end up with a simple logistic regression algorithm, in another word the neural network change into logistic regression.

## 4. What's gradient ? Why we use gradient ? What gradient tell us ?

**Gradient** of any function `[src2]` is a vector with its partial derivatives.

**Gradient** `[src3]` is talk about change. this slope telling us how quickly is change, by finding the gradient of the that graph bellow we know how quickly is changing.

**Gradient** `[src4]` is another word for "slope". The higher the gradient of a graph at a point, the steeper the line is at that point.

+ A positive gradient means that the line slopes goind upwards.
+ A negative gradient means that the line slopes downwards.

## 5. What's Gradient Descent ?

+ Gradient descent measures the local gradient of the error function with regards to the parameter vector θ.

+ When gradient is zero you are in the bottom (the minimum), keep in minde could be many minimums local and global.

+ An important parameter in Gradient Descent is the size of the steps, determined by
the learning rate hyperparameter.
